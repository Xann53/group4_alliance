				If your beloved canine companion frequently showers you with affectionate licks,
				you'll undoubtedly become intimately acquainted with the sensation of moist
				slobber adorning your visage, enveloping your hands, and encircling your mouth.
				Whether you find yourself engaged in a gentle petting session, nourishing your 
				faithful companion with nourishment, or receiving an exuberant welcome as you cross
				the threshold of your abode, the art of being licked by your furry friend becomes an 
				integral part of your daily routine. The act of receiving these moist expressions of 
				love from your dog serves as a heartwarming gesture of fondness, yet it harbors a myriad
				of intricate interpretations and significances beyond its apparent display of affection.

		Dogs have an instinct to lick
	</div>
	<p style="padding-left:20px;">
		Licking is an important part of being a dog. It’s how they groom, show emotion and communicate.
		Mothers will often lick their puppies to keep them clean, give them comfort and encourage them
		to go to the toilet. Puppies will groom themselves and their family and, aside from being a good
		way to clean, it's also a sign of love, affection and a great way to bond.

		They’re showing affection
	</div>
	<p style="padding-left:20px;">
		Dogs often show affection by licking. It’s an instinctive behaviour that’s linked to the comfort
		they felt when their mother licked them as a puppy. Licking plays an important part of how they
		bond with others, causing them to release dopamine and endorphins that help make them feel relaxed,
		calm and happy.

		They’re showing empathy
	</div>
	<p style="padding-left:20px;">
		For dogs, licking is a comforting behaviour. If your dog is concerned about you, they may try and lick
		you to make you feel better and care for you. In a 2012 study, researchers asked owners to pretend to
		cry and found that their dogs were more likely to lick and nuzzle them than when their owners were
		just humming or talking. It’s possible that these dogs were just displaying a learnt behaviour,
		but many of us would argue that dogs can, to some extent at least, share and understand our feelings.
